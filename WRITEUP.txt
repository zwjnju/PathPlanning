1. I define a function "lane_num" to get the car_lane, which is 0(left) or 1(middle) or 2(right).(line18--line32);
2. I read the relevant message in line52--line70;
3. I define three bool variables of state: too_closed, change_left_lane, change_right_lane, in line137--line139, which represents whether the car is too close with others, whether to change the left lane, the right lane, respectively;
4. In the following part, I mainly do two things: one is set the values of the three variable above, the other is draw the trajectory;
5. I define the variable "v_lane" and "check_car_s" to representate all the vehicles' lanes and the distances between the car to others, respectively;
6. I first raise a for loop to set the "too_closed";
7. Then I raise another for loop to set the "change_lane_left" and "change_lane_right";
8. Then I use the three variables to set the variable of "lane", which is used to draw the trajectory;
9. I draw the trajectory finally.
