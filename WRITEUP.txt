1. I define a function "lane_num" to get the car_lane, which is 0(left) or 1(middle) or 2(right).(line18--line32);
2. I read the relevant message in line52--line70;
3. I define three bool variables of state: too_closed, change_left_lane, change_right_lane, in line137--line139, which represents whether the car is too close with others, whether to change the left lane, the right lane, respectively;
4. In the following part, I mainly do two things: one is set the values of the three variable above, the other is draw the trajectory;
5. I define a variable "v_lane" to representate all the vehicles' lane;
5. In line148--line192, I search the next action;
6. In line195--line228, I calculate the next lane and velocity;
7. In 230--line325, I generate the trajectory.
